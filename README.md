# DayZ-Stalker-Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for a unique multiplayer mod that brings the atmospheric and immersive world of **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** into the **DayZ** engine. The project is divided into client and server components to enable a seamless and functional integration of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-inspired gameplay mechanics into a DayZ server. Please note that **no official support** is provided for this project.

## Client Component
The client component includes all client-side scripts and resources required for players to interact with and experience the game world. Key features include:

- **User Interface (UI):** Customizations and extensions to the DayZ user interface to display S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-specific elements.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Implementation of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-style mechanics such as anomalies, artifacts, and factions.
- **Graphics and Sounds:** Integration of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-specific graphics and sound effects to enhance immersion.

## Server Component
The server component contains the server-side logic necessary for managing the gameplay experience and data, including spawns, loot, and more. Integration is achieved through a limited API. Key features include:

- **Gameplay Logic:** Server-side implementation of game mechanics to ensure a consistent player experience.
- **Data Management:** Management of spawns, loot, and other game-related data.

## Programming Language
The entire codebase is written in **Enforce Script**, a scripting language used in the DayZ engine. Enforce Script closely resembles **C++**, sharing many syntactic and structural similarities. This makes it relatively easy for developers familiar with C++ to adapt to Enforce Script.
